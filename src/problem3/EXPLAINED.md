### Improvements Explained

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - The `getPriority` function is responsible for determining the priority of a blockchain, and the `formatBalance` function is responsible for formatting a balance. The main component, `WalletPage`, focuses on rendering the wallet balances.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Both `getPriority` and `formatBalance` can be extended with new logic or additional blockchain types without modifying the existing functions, adhering to the OCP.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Ensuring that each component adheres to the same interface or contract guarantees that components can be replaced or extended without breaking the application.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - We defined concise interfaces, `WalletBalance` and `FormattedWalletBalance`, that contain only necessary properties, avoiding large and unwieldy interfaces.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - By using hooks like `useWalletBalances` and `usePrices`, we abstracted data fetching logic, ensuring that the main component does not directly depend on low-level data-fetching details.

### Security

- **Sanitization:** Ensuring that data from external sources is handled safely to avoid injection attacks.
- **Validation:** Verifying that values are valid before processing them, such as ensuring that `prices[balance.currency]` exists and is a valid number.
- **Security Headers:** Utilizing libraries like Helmet to add security headers, protecting the application from common web vulnerabilities.
